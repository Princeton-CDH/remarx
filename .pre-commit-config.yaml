# This configuration file specifies which hooks to run (ruff, prettier, and codespell), the versions of each tool, arguments to pass, and which files to include or exclude.
# It ensures that code is linted, formatted, and checked for spelling and quality issues automatically on every commit.
# To set up, run 'pre-commit install'. You can also run all hooks manually with 'pre-commit run --all-files'.
