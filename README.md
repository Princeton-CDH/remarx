# Citing Marx - Experiment 1: AI Sandbox

This is work associated with the CDH project [Citing Marx](https://cdh.princeton.edu/projects/citing-marx/)

## AI Sandbox experiment

This branch contains code and data for preliminary experiments with
Princeton's AI Sandbox to extract Marx titles and quotations from sample project text content.

### Contents

- `data/`
  - `annotation/`: snapshot of annotation data exported from Recogito; CSV files
  - title mentions and direct quote subset datasets for experimenting
  - `model_responses/`: CSV files generated by submitting prompts to AI Sandbox models
- `prompts/` : text files of the prompts drafted for title mention and quotation detection tasks
- `notebooks/`: marimo notebooks for data exploration, experimentation, and review
- `src/remarx/`: python package with utility code related to AI sandbox and notebooks


## Models

### AI Sandbox models

These are the models available in the AI Sandbox at the end of the time when
we ran these experiments:

- o3-mini
- gpt-4o-mini
- gpt-4o
- gpt-35-turbo-16k
- Meta-Llama-3-1-70B-Instruct
- Meta-Llama-3-1-8B-Instruct
- Mistral-small


Experimentation included all models currently available in the AI
Sandbox as well as local llama3.2 and mixtral models run with ollama.

Data in model_responses was generated by the following models:
- title mentions:  all AI Sandbox models
- quotations: o3-mini, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o

## Development Instructions

### Developer setup and installation
- **Recommended:** create a python virtual environment with your tool of choice (virtualenv, conda, etc); use python 3.12 or higher

- Install the local checked out version of this package in editable mode (`-e`), including all python dependencies and optional dependencies for development and testing:

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

- This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for python code linting and consistent formatting. Run this command to initialize and install pre-commit hooks:

```sh
pre-commit install
```
### AI Sandbox API key setup

In order to use the AI Sandbox API, you must have a API key. You must set the
environment variable `AI_SANDBOX_KEY` to your API key value. Do this by creating
a `.env` file in the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` with the following
line:
```
AI_SANDBOX_KEY=[your_api_key]
```

### Marimo notebook setup

The notebook for selecting direct quote annotations requires
that you manually add a copy of `1896-97aCLEAN.txt` to `/data/text/`.

Use `marimo` to run notebook:

```console
marimo edit notebooks/quote-data.py
```

This notebook has been configured to save Jupyter notebook snapshots for
viewing on GitHub.
